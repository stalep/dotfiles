# dotfiles

This repo contains the latest version of my dotfiles.
Atm there are no install instructions so it is up to the reader to install whatever dependencies needed.
The colorscheme is Gruvbox.

My work environment is:

| purpose | tool |
|---------|------|
| editor | Neovim |
| terminal multiplexer | Tmux |
| shell | Fish |
| terminal application | Alacritty |
